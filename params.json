  "body": "### About Open Device lab Cologne\r\n\r\nKnowing what it means not having the right devices to test mobile applications, we want to support the Cologne's developer community with a wide range of devices to test their newest mobile projects. A lot of Open Device labs are appearing around the globe, but we haven't found any in Cologne yet. Therefore we decided to open up the first Open Device lab in Cologne. We are still getting started by setting up the lab, the right testing environment and collecting more devices. If that sounds interesting to you and you want to get started by testing, contributing or supporting us setting up the lab, feel free to get in touch. You want to learn more about Open Device labs or even set up your own? Don't miss this article!\r\n\r\n### Contribute\r\nAnyone can participate. You have got some spare devices and want to contribute them to the lab?
